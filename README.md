<p>- use the programs labeled 60053a.<br>- farside and nearside programs should be respectively named. <br>- just in case, double check the variable <i>invert</i> and make sure it is the correct number.<br><h1>Controls</h1><br>- L1 should rotate forward 90 degrees forward<br>- L2 should rotate 90 degrees backward<br>- Pressing both L buttons at the same time should toggle between "coast" and "hold" arm stopping patterns. Arm is set by default to coast.<br>- R1 should flip the the arm forward wildly.<br>- R2 should do it in reverse.<br>- uncomment lines 277 and 278 and comment out lines 274 and 275 for one-stick control.<h1>Troubleshooting</h1><br>- if the robot is acting weird, check that the motor ports are correct. horsley or a teammate may need to look at the code to double check that the motors are in the right ports.<br>- if you're sure the code is not working properly, ask horsley or any other programmers for help. Joey and Falyssa should know how to write code similar to C++.<br><b>To keep the most updated version of a program or change a program, fork it from the repo. You must be logged in for this. If anybody changes a program, make those same changes to its sister program, but keep the invert variable as it is supposed to be depending on whether the program is for near or far side. It may just be easier to copy one file's text, overwrite the other program, and just change the invert variable.</b></p>
