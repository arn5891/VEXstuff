<p>- use the programs labeled 60053a.<br>- farside and nearside programs should be respectively named. <br>- just in case, double check the variable <i>invert</i> and make sure it is the correct number.<br><h1>Controls</h1><br>- L1 should rotate forward 90 degrees forward<br>- L2 should rotate 90 degrees backward<br>- Pressing both L buttons at the same time should toggle between coast and hold arm stopping patterns. Arm is set by default to coast.<br>- R1 should flip the the arm forward wildly.<br>- R2 should do it in reverse.<br>- uncomment lines 277 and 278 and comment out lines 274 and 275 for one-stick control.<h1>Troubleshooting</h1><br>- if the robot is acting weird, check that the motor ports are correct. horsley or a teammate may need to look at the code to double check that the motors are in the right ports.<br>- if you're sure the code is not working properly, ask horsley or any other programmers for help. Joey and Falyssa should know how to write code similar to C++.</p>
